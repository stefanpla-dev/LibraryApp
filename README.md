I must confess that there isn't much to see here at this time. At best, this will become a rudimentary library application to serve as a foundation on which my knowledge of Daml will rest. 

Why a library?

To my knowledge, Daml is a language created by and intended for financial institutions whose primary concerns are security, legibility, and uniformity across platforms. While I have little knowledge of financial institutions and the ways in which or reasons why they conduct the business that they do, I am quite familiar with the contractual relationships between libraries, their patrons, the books in their possession, and the library card as a conduit between all of those things. It strikes me as an easy allegory to begin exploring the language.

Stay tuned, audience of none.
